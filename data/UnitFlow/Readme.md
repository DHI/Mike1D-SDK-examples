# UnitFlow example
This folder contains a number of very simple models that are used
to show how plugins and scripts are applied.

## Preparing examples
Run the Prepare.bat method before running the models.

The Prepare.bat file will copy over various files (scripts) from elsewhere to this
folder, which are required for the models to run.
