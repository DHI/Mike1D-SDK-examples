# M1DSimulator
Wrapper for setting up and simulating a MIKE 1D model from C# code using the M1D SDK. Enables easy getting and setting of M1D engine variables, e.g. water levels or discharges, and variables related to real-time control, e.g. PID setpoints. Designed for use from outside .NET environments, e.g. Matlab (see example).

The Release folder contains all required M1D DLL's from MIKE 2017.1. Requires a license to run the simulation.

The code will be continuously improved and extended with more functionality.
